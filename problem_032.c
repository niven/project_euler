We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; 
for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, 
and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

First thoughts: this seems like a sudoku kind of thing:
nnnnK x nnnnP fixes the digit in nnnnnnQ
3x4 = ......2 etc
which then reduces the search space vastly

Then there is something with the length of the numbers maybe? 2x3=12 and then we're missing digits
so
n(k) x n(p) = n(max(k,p)+1) at maxium

More boringly: take all numbers 1-9 (9! = 362880) and just factor them, except that you need digits on the left side as
well, so it's really 9 choose 7 = 181440 as a ceiling.
Even just constructing the numbers on the left would be easier than factoring I guess.

Hmm. Maybe there is a more elegant way, maybe by construction?

multipying numbers will always result in a result that has at least digits
equal to the min length of multiplicand and multiplier
well, the above is true but not useful. Some thinking will show that N3 must be 4 digits
which I then put in the for loop condition: but it is even better to just generate all unqiue permutations
of 4 out of 9 digits. C(9, 4) = 126 ( 9*8*7*6 / 4*3*2*1  = 9*7*6 / 3 = 9*7*2 = 63*2 = 126)

But how to generate those? (after that: either pick out the remaining numbers and form into multiplicand/multiplier
 or just factor the number in all ways an check for pandigitalness)

C(3,2) = 3*2/2 = 3
123:
12
23

C(4,2) = 4*3/2 = 6
1234:

12
13
14
23
24
34

Seems quite regular
C(4,3) = 4*3*2 / 3*2 = 4
1234:

123
124
134
234

Pattern C(4,3):
	1 + C(3,2) = 3x'1'
		2 + C(2,1) = 2x'2'
			3,4
		3 + C(1,1) = 1x'3'
			4
	2 + C(2,2) = 1x'2'
			34

So to produce C(4,3):
	element[0] + C(3,2)
	element[1] + C(2,2)
	done (since n == k)

So the idea is to C(9,4) to find all unique sets of 4 digits (9*8*7*6 / 4*3*2 = 126), 
then for each of those find all permutations so we end up all unique P (for N x M = P )
so we never check any double results.

Then take the remaining digits, find all permutations and split them into multiplicand/multipliers (N x M)
and check if N x M == P
This means 5! = 120 combinations of 5 digits, which each split into 1,4 2,3 3,2 4,1 parts for N x M (4 ways each)
But since we are permiting, 1234 split as 12x34 is the same as 34x12 so we end up with half that
(and just swapping N and M when N>M lets us skip the doubles)

Example:

123:
123
1 x 23 KEEP
12 x 3 N>M
132
1 x 32 KEEP
13 x 2 N>M
213
2 x 13 KEEP
21 x 3 N>M
231
2 x 31 KEEP
23 x 1 N>M
312
3 x 12 KEEP
31 x 2 N>M
321
3 x 21 KEEP
32 x 1 N>M

KEEP:
1 x 23
1 x 32
2 x 13
2 x 31
3 x 12
3 x 21

Optimization: make sure length N <= length M. In this case the number of elements is 5, so we need only 1,4 and 2,3 splits :)


So ultimately:
C(9,4) = 126 result sets
4! permutations of the result sets = 24
Then 5! permutations of the remainders = 120
Then for each of those 4 ways to split into N x M of which each occurs twice


126 x 24 x 120 x 4 / 2 = 725,760 things to check
